24/09/2021 - version: 2.1.1
- You now can use npm run prod-no-cr to run it without chunk remover.
- The watcher should now be fixed, you should be able to keep theme kit running and the other watcher starting after it now.
- There is now default globals.json and images.json files, the actual content yet to be decided just used en-GB ones for now,
  then it loads the locale version and should override properties.
- There is a new logging system that has overhauled the output capabilities of the script and introduces --log-levels= option.
- The 5 chunks a time on the remover should be back working as it was.
- Did some re-factoring of functions that were just too big and complex and broke them down.
- Lodash is now a dependency but it was in package.json anyway, Winston is a new dependency and provides our logging functionality.
  (make sure to npm install)
- Other small fixes to output and error handling.
